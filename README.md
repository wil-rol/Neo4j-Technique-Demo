# Neo4j-Technique-Demo
A demonstration of Neo4j proficiency using made-up data, showcasing various querying techniques, data manipulation, and database design concepts.

# Dataset
The data in Table 1 was provided by the class professor and do not represent any real world dataset.

# Methodology
"This project demonstrates proficiency in graph database design and querying using Neo4j, leveraging the same made-up dataset used for demonstrations. The methodology involves structuring data as nodes and relationships to optimize for connected data scenarios. The dataset is modeled using graph theory principles, defining entities as nodes and their interactions as relationships, with properties assigned to both. Cypher queries are utilized for data retrieval, including pattern matching, traversals, and pathfinding operations. The project also explores graph algorithms such as centrality analysis and community detection to derive insights. Indexing, constraints, and query optimization techniques are applied to enhance performance, showcasing the advantages of graph databases for relationship-driven data analysis."
